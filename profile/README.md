> A curated registry of **ratatui** - powered terminal applications

Ratcrate is your go-to resource for discovering terminal user interface (TUI) applications built with [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui). We maintain an up-to-date catalog of ratatui-based projects to help developers find inspiration and users discover powerful terminal applications.
